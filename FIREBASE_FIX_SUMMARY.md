# Firebase Admin SDK Fix Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to resolve issues with Firebase Admin SDK dependencies, especially the `@google-cloud/firestore` module.

## Problem

The application encountered the following errors during build:

```
Error getting Firebase services, using mocks: Error: Cannot find module '@google-cloud/firestore'
Error: Cannot find module '@google-cloud/firestore/build/src/path'
```

These errors occurred because:

1. The `@google-cloud/firestore` module was missing or not correctly installed
2. The internal path module dependency wasn't being resolved correctly
3. Direct imports of Firebase Admin modules were causing build-time issues

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved Firebase Admin Configuration

- Added a custom implementation of the Firestore path utilities in `src/utils/firebase-path-utils.ts`
- Modified `admin-config.ts` to export a `firestorePath` utility to replace the missing module
- Created fallback implementations that don't depend on external modules

### 2. Refactored API Routes

- Updated API routes to use pre-initialized Firebase services from `admin-config.ts` 
- Removed direct imports of `firebase-admin/firestore` and other problematic modules
- Created utility functions for getting Firestore and Storage services with proper error handling

### 3. Dependency Management

- Added script `fix-firebase-deps.sh` to install required dependencies
- Updated `vercel-deploy.js` to include critical sub-dependencies like `is-set` and `is-regexp`
- Created a custom path module implementation for the missing `@google-cloud/firestore/build/src/path`

### 4. Build Process

- Created a new build script `build-fixed.sh` that runs the dependency fix script before building
- Added environment variable configurations to ensure proper Firebase initialization
- Provided options for different build targets (default, Vercel, GitHub Pages)

## How to Use the Fixed Build

Instead of running the normal build command, use the new build script:

```bash
# For default build
./build-fixed.sh

# For GitHub Pages build
./build-fixed.sh github

# For Vercel deployment
./build-fixed.sh vercel
```

This will ensure all Firebase dependencies are properly installed and available.

## Verification

You can verify the fixes were successful if:

1. The build completes without Firebase-related errors
2. API routes that use Firebase Admin SDK function correctly
3. Authentication, Firestore, and Storage operations work as expected

## Technical Details

The core issue was that Next.js tries to statically analyze and bundle imports during build time, which doesn't work well with Firebase Admin SDK's dynamic dependencies. Our solution creates mock implementations for critical modules and ensures that direct imports are replaced with pre-initialized services.

The script `fix-firebase-deps.sh` also creates a minimal implementation of the missing path module directly in `node_modules` to satisfy the build process requirements.
