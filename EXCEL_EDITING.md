## How to Use

### Analyzing Excel Files

When uploading an Excel file, Claude automatically:
1. Extracts the data structure
2. Identifies column headers and data types
3. Analyzes patterns and relationships
4. Provides insights about the data

Example prompt: "What insights can you give me about this spreadsheet?"

### Editing Excel Files

To edit Excel files, use natural language instructions like:

```
Change cell A1 to 'Sales Report'
Update B5 to 1000
Set cell C7 to a formula =SUM(C1:C6)
Add 'Q3' to cell D2
```

Claude will:
1. Parse your instructions
2. Apply the edits to the spreadsheet
3. Create a new version with the changes
4. Provide confirmation of the changes made

### Multiple Edits

For multiple edits, list each change on a separate line:

```
I'll change cell A1 to 'Header'
I'll change cell B1 to 'Value'
I'll change cell C1 to 'Total'
```

### Advanced Features

- **Sheet Specification**: "In sheet 'Data', change cell B5 to 100"
- **Range Operations**: "Sum all values in column B and put the result in B10"
- **Conditional Edits**: "For all cells in column A with 'Error', change to 'Fixed'"
- **Formula Creation**: "Create a formula in D10 that calculates the average of D1:D9"

## Technical Details

### Edit Pattern Detection

The system recognizes various edit patterns including:

1. Claude 3.7 standard format: "I'll change cell A1 to 'Sales Report'"
2. Direct instructions: "Change cell B5 to 100"
3. Colon syntax: "A1: 'Header'"
4. Value references: "Set the value in C7 to =SUM(C1:C6)"
5. Placement patterns: "Put 'Total' in D10"
6. Formula specifications: "Set formula in E5 to =AVERAGE(E1:E4)"

### Excel Processing Pipeline

1. User uploads Excel file
2. System extracts data and generates Claude prompt
3. Claude analyzes and responds with insights
4. User requests edits
5. Claude responds with specific edit instructions
6. System parses instructions and applies edits
7. Modified file is saved and provided to user
