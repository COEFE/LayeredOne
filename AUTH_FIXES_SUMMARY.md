# Authentication Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix authentication issues with Next.js and Firebase on Vercel.

## Issues Fixed

1. **404 Errors in Authentication Flow**
   - RSC (React Server Components) navigation causing 404 errors
   - Email signup workflow navigation issues
   - Google authentication domain errors on Vercel preview deployments

2. **Firebase Unauthorized Domain Errors**
   - Google sign-in failing on Vercel preview URLs
   - Custom error handling for better debugging

## Files Changed

1. **`src/app/signup/page.tsx` & `src/app/login/page.tsx`**
   - Replaced Next.js `<Link>` components with custom anchor tags
   - Added `window.location.href` navigation to avoid RSC prefetching
   - Enhanced error handling for common authentication errors

2. **`src/app/reset-password/page.tsx`**
   - Created new page for password reset functionality
   - Implemented client-side navigation to avoid RSC issues
   - Added comprehensive error handling

3. **`src/firebase/config.ts`**
   - Enhanced dynamic domain handling for production environments
   - Added detailed logging for Vercel preview deployments
   - Improved environment detection logic

4. **`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`**
   - Enhanced error handling for Google authentication
   - Added specific error messages for common authentication errors
   - Improved unauthorized domain error detection for Vercel preview URLs
   - Added utility functions for deployment environment detection

5. **`src/middleware.ts`**
   - Added special handling for authentication routes
   - Added detection and skipping of RSC requests
   - Improved routing for auth pages

6. **`src/utils/deployment.ts`** (New)
   - Created utility functions for deployment environment detection
   - Added helpers for Firebase domain authorization recommendations
   - Implemented Vercel preview URL detection

7. **`VERCEL_PREVIEW_AUTH.md`** (New)
   - Comprehensive guide for handling Firebase auth with Vercel preview deployments
   - Short-term, medium-term, and long-term solutions documented
   - Troubleshooting steps for common auth issues

## Technical Approach

1. **Client-Side Navigation**
   - Replaced Next.js Link components with standard anchor tags
   - Used `window.location.href` for navigation to avoid RSC issues
   - Made sure all auth flow links use this approach

2. **Dynamic Domain Authorization**
   - Added code to detect current hostname
   - Set Firebase authDomain to match current hostname in production
   - Enhanced error reporting for unauthorized domains

3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Added specific error detection for common auth issues
   - Created user-friendly error messages
   - Added detailed console logging for developers

4. **Middleware Enhancements**
   - Added detection for RSC requests to avoid interference
   - Improved handling of auth-related routes

## Next Steps

1. **Firebase Configuration**
   - Add all relevant domains to Firebase Console > Authentication > Settings > Authorized Domains
   - Consider using a wildcard domain strategy if possible
   - For long-term, consider separate Firebase projects for dev/staging/prod

2. **Testing**
   - Test full authentication flow (signup → login → protected page)
   - Test on both production and preview deployments
   - Verify both Google and Email auth methods

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep VERCEL_PREVIEW_AUTH.md updated with any new findings
   - Document any remaining issues or edge cases
   - Add a troubleshooting section to the main README
